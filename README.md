# javaScript_Quiz

## Description
This is the 4th assignment homework, or submission.  The student was given the task to incorporate all three main fields of practice: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript [JS] in order to create a multiple choice quiz, with the main focus on JavaScript.  The quiz is composed of four (4) multiple choice questions.  When the user hits "Start", a timer will start.  If the user selects an incorrect answer, the timer will decrease by 10.0 seconds.  Responses will display for correct and incorrect submissisons for each question.  The final score will be logged as how much time is left.  The user will then be able to submit initials using Local Storage to display on the page. 



## Code Contributors 

The project was completed by each student. This was completed by Paul Nixon.


## User Story

## Acceptance Criteria
The assignment is complete when all aspects of the UPENN Module #4 Acceptance Criteria points are met.
